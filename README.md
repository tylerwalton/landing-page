# <u> **Week 2 challenge**</u>
There were a few key points to this project. One of which was to give us a place for our future employers to see our work.
Another was to allow us to refine our skills in web developement by using HTML and CSS together to make this portfolio from scratch.
Lastly making sure that we had a responsive layout that adpated to the users viewport.
